#### My landlord wants to evict me
#### and
#### I have received a letter or notice telling me to leave.

*This is the first step in the eviction process. You do not need to
leave by the date stated in the notice. Your landlord can only start an
eviction case against you after the date you are told to leave has
passed.*

Here are some steps you can take.

##### Educate yourself about your rights and options: 

Use this time to educate yourself about your rights and options. If you
received a notice to quit for nonpayment of rent, you have the right to
pay what you owe and stop the landlord from starting an eviction case in
court.

Depending on the reason why the landlord has served you with a notice to
quit, you may have defenses and counterclaims that you can raise in an
Answer after the court eviction case has begun. Learn more about ways to

##### Talk to your landlord: 

Some landlords may be willing to resolve the issues underlying the
notice to quit without going to court. If your eviction is because you
owe rent, some landlords will still make a payment plan and let you stay
as long as you can get caught up on your rent. Even if a landlord is not
interested in letting you stay long term, many landlords will agree to
give you a reasonable amount of time to move on your own because the
landlord has to pay money to have you physically evicted.
