Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
    ====================================

Your landlord wants to raise the rent and you have a project based Section 8 or MRVP housing
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a subsidy that is fixed to the apartment, usually, your rent
is based on your household income.

If your household income changes and you report the change when you are
supposed to, expect your rent to change

If you do not agree that the landlord has set the amount of your rent
correctly, you can ask your worker or property manager for a meeting to
review how they calculated your rent.

You may find they do not have the correct amount for your household
income. If this is the problem, ask them to redo the calculation.

If you did not report an increase in your income on time, your landlord
can change your rent retroactively. That is, they will go back to the
date your income increased and charge you rent you should have paid from
that date.

If they are charging you for past rent due, ask for a meeting to set-up
a payment plan.

Some subsidized apartments have rents that are not tied to your income.
You pay a fixed rent that is below market rent because the landlord has
agreed to rent to persons who have a low income.

If you live in a subsidized apartment and your rent is not tied to your
income, your landlord can only increase your rent if they get approval
from a government agency.

Your lease will explain when and how your landlord can get approval to
raise your rent.
