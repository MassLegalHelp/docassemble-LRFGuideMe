**Guide Me**: My landlord wants to raise the rent

And

I have a project based Section 8 or MRVP housing

If you have a subsidy that is fixed to the apartment, your rent is
typically set based on your household income. So if your household
income changes, and you have timely reported that change in income, you
can expect a change in your rent.

If you don't agree that the landlord has set the amount of your rent
correctly, you can request a meeting with your worker or property
manager to review how they calculated your rent. You may find they have
the amount of your household income wrong, and you can then ask them to
redo the calculation.

If you did not timely report an increase in your income, your landlord
can change your rent retroactively. If this is your situation, you
should request a meeting to set-up a payment plan.

Some subsidized apartments have rents that are not tied to your income.
In other words, you pay a fixed rent that is below market rent because
the landlord has agreed to rent to persons who are low income. If you
live in one of these types of subsidized apartments, the rent can only
go-up when the landlord receives approval from a government agency. Your
lease will explain when and how this can happen.
