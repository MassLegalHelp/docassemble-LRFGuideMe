Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

You live in subsidized or public housing,
-----------------------------------------

You think you are paying the wrong rent, and 
--------------------------------------------

You have informed your worker or property manager that you lost income, but you have heard nothing back
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Call your worker or property manager

If you have not heard back from your worker, call.

You might find the worker is waiting for you to provide some proof that
you lost income. They call this proof, \"verification.\"

#### Be pro-active if you do not hear from your worker

Make sure you **wrote** and you told your worker or property manager
about your lost income. Keep a copy of the letter.

If you only tell them in person or leave a message on their phone,
sometimes workers or property managers forget that you told them you a
lost income.

It is important to report in writing if your income goes down. Do this
as soon as you know that your income is going down. Date and keep copies
of this written notice. This will create proof if there is a dispute on
when you gave notice. In most cases, your rent will get lowered as of
the first month that follows your giving notice.
