**Call your worker or property manager:**

if you have not heard back from your worker, call. You might find out
that the worker is waiting for you to provide some verification of the
loss of income,. Be pro-active if you have not heard further from your
worker.

**Make sure that you told your worker or property manager about your
reduced income [in writing]{.underline}:**

Sometimes workers or property managers forget if all you did was report
in person or left a message about a loss of income. Therefor it is
really important that you report in writing if your income goes down. Do
this as soon as you know that your income is going down. Date and keep
copies of this written notice. This will create proof if there is a
dispute on when you gave notice. In most cases, your rent will get
lowered as of the first month that follows your giving notice.
