*This is your court date. It is really important that you show-up for
court -- even if you think you have worked everything out with your
landlord. If you do not show-up, the landlord can request a default
judgment against you.*

**Here are some steps you can take.**

**File an Answer:**

An Answer is a legal form completed by you that explains why you should
not be evicted. In other words, it contains your defense to the
eviction. If you are being evicted for non payment of rent or are being
evicted without fault attributed to you, you can also bring
counterclaims against your landlord for things the landlord did wrong.
At the bottom of your eviction summons and complaint, it states the date
you must file an Answer with the court. A copy must also be served on
the landlord (or their lawyer) by this same date. Learn more about
preparing an Answer at

**Serve a Demand for Discovery:**

Discovery refers to the process by which parties to a court case can
request information from the other side in order to better prepare for
trial. In eviction cases, it takes the form of a list of questions
(called interrogatories) and a request for documents. You have the right
to serve a Demand for Discovery on your landlord by the same date as the
Answer due date. If you timely serve your Demand for Discovery, your
hearing date will be postponed for two weeks. Learn more about serving
discovery at

**File a Notice of Transfer to Housing Court:**

If your landlord filed the eviction case in a District Court, you have
the right to transfer the case to the Housing Court. This is recommended
because the Housing Court has more resources to help tenants who are
representing themselves. Learn more about requesting a Transfer at
