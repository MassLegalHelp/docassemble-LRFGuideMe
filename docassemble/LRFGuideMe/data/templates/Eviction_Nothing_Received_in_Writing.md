Guide Me: Steps to take when...
===============================

Your landlord wants to evict you, but you have not received anything in writing telling you to leave
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Educate yourself about your rights and options

Use this time to educate yourself about your rights and options.

[Learn about ways to stop or delay an eviction](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/evictions). 

#### You may be eligible to stop an eviction where your landlord is asking for back rent

You might be protected by the federal CDC Moratorium if you:

-   cannot pay your full rent becauseÂ you have lost income or have high
    medical expenses, 

-   are making best efforts to pay the rent including applying for
    financial help, and

-   are likely to become homeless or doubled up if evicted.

[Learn more about the moratorium](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/covid-19/housing), and how to send your landlord a
[declaration](https://MassLegalHelp.org/cdc-declaration.pdf) that you are protected by the federal CDC moratorium on
evictions.

#### Talk to your landlord

Some landlords may be willing to resolve the issues without going to
court.

If your landlord needs you to move because he is taking your unit off
the rental market, you may be able to get them to agree to:

-   give you more time before you move out, and

-   avoid going to court.
