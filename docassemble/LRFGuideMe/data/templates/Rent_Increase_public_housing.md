**Guide Me**: My landlord wants to raise the rent

And

I live in public housing

f you live in public housing, your rent is typically set based on your
household income. So if your household income changes, and you have
timely reported that change in income, you can expect a change in your
rent.

If you don't agree that the housing authority has set the amount of your
rent correctly, you can request a meeting with your worker to review how
they calculated your rent. You may find they have the amount of your
household income wrong, and you can then ask them to redo the
calculation.

If you did not timely report an increase in your income, the housing
authority can change your rent retroactively. If this is your situation,
you should request a meeting to set-up a payment plan.
