Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

My landlord wants to raise the rent and you live in public housing
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you live in public housing, usually, your rent is based on your
household income.

If your household income changes, and you report the change when you are
supposed to, expect your rent to change.

If you do not agree that the housing authority has set the amount of
your rent correctly, you can ask for a meeting with your worker to
review how they calculated your rent.

You may find they do not have the correct amount for your household
income. If this is the problem, you ask them to redo the calculation.

If you did not report an increase in your income on time, the housing
authority can change your rent retroactively. That is, they will go back
to the date your income increased and charge you the rent you should
have paid from that date.

If they are charging you for past rent due, ask for a meeting to set-up
a payment plan.
