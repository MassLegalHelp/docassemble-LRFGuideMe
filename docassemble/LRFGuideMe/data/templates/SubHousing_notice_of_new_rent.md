Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

You live in subsidized or public housing,
------------------------------------------

You think you are paying the wrong rent now, and
------------------------------------------------

Your worker or property manager sent you a notice of your rent and you think that is wrong also
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Ask your worker or property manager for a meeting

If you live in **public** housing or you have a **mobile Section 8
voucher**, you have the right to ask for an informal hearing if you
think your rent is wrong.

Your notice of rent change should have included information about this
right.

If you live in **private** subsidized housing, you do **not** have the
right to a hearing. But your landlord must still discuss your rent with
you, if you think they made a mistake. So, ask your landlord for a
meeting.
