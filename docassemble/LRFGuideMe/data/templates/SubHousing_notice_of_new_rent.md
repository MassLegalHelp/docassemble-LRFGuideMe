#### My worker or property manager has sent me a notice stating my new rent and I don't think it is correct

##### Ask for a meeting with your worker or property manager

If you live in *public housing* or have a *mobile Section 8 voucher*,
you have the right to request an informal hearing or grievance if you
think your rent is wrong. This should have been stated in your rent
change notice.

If you live in *private subsidized housing*, you do not have a right to
a hearing or grievance but the landlord is still required to consult
with you if you think a mistake has been made. So ask for a meeting.
