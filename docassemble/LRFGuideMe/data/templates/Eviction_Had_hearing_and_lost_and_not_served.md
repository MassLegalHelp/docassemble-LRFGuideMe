#### My landlord wants to evict me 
#### and
#### I had a hearing before a judge and lost 
#### and
#### I have not been served with a notice of scheduled eviction.

*This means that a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if you owed
rent, for damages has been entered against you. It will also state that
you have to pay the landlord's court costs and interest that has come
due on any unpaid rent.*

*Eleven days after the date of the judgment, the landlord can request an
Execution from the court. This is the legal document a landlord needs to
schedule a date to have you physically evicted if you do not leave on
your own.*

Here are some steps you can take:

##### Option 1. File an Appeal: 

You can file an Appeal, but you only have 10 days from the date of the
judgment to do this. Learn more about filing an Appeal here,

##### Option 2. Seek a Stay of the Execution:

You can file a motion seeking a stay of execution. If the court grants a
stay of the execution it means the landlord cannot move forward with
physically evicting you until the stay ends or is lifted. Learn more

##### Option 3. Talk to Your Landlord:

Even after you lose your eviction case, many landlords are still willing
to negotiate an agreement with you. If your eviction is because you owe
rent, some landlords will still make a payment plan and let you stay as
long as you can get caught up on your rent. Even if a landlord is not
interested in letting you stay long term, many landlords will agree to
give you a reasonable amount of time to move on your own because the
landlord has to pay more money to have you physically evicted.
