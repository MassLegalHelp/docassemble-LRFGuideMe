#### I am behind on my rent.

Here are some steps that you can take.

##### Apply for RAFT: 

If Eligible - RAFT offers financial assistance to help pay back rent.

Eligibility Depends on:

-   Your family MUST be homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.

-   Your household MUST be income eligible

-   Must meet basic criteria of a RAFT Screen

-   Your family MUST show that RAFT assistance will stabilize your
    current housing situation.

##### Make A Payment Plan With Your Landlord: 

Many landlords are more interested in getting the rent paid than
evicting you, and will allow you to make payments plans. Many tenants
have been able to put together payments plans drawing from their own
resources, the RAFT program and charities to make a payment plan. It is
recommended that you start working on a plan with your landlord as soon
as possible. Ask your landlord if they will make a payment plan without
going to court. If not possible, then wait to see if you can make a
payment plan as part of the eviction case.

##### Go to Court Even If You Think You Have Worked It Out With Your Landlord:

If your landlord started an eviction case against you in court, make
sure to attend court on your hearing date -- even if you think you have
worked it out with your landlord or paid off your back rent. The
landlord could ask for a default judgment against you if you don't
show-up.

**Contact local charities or religious organizations to ask if they have
any services that may help.**
