### I have bad conditions that need to be fixed

Here are some steps that you can take.

##### Send a letter to your landlord

First tell your landlord about the bad conditions in writing. It is
really important that your notice to the landlord be in writing to
protect you in case the landlord later claims he or she never had
notice. Make sure you put a date on the notice, and keep a copy of what
you send for your records.

##### Get an inspection

If your landlord does not respond to your request to make repairs, you
should get an inspection. Every city and town has a Board of Health or
Code Enforcement Department that is responsible for making sure that
your apartment meets the minimum standards for health and safety
contained in the state sanitary code.

##### Withhold rent only if you can save it
Withholding rent can be an effective way to get your landlord to (finally) make the repairs. However, it also has the potential to
 upset your landlord and should only be done carefully. Some landlords will try to turn this around and start proceedings to evict you for non payment of rent. A landlord, however, will not be able to evict you if you have carefully withheld your rent. You should only
 intentionally withhold your rent if you can meet all of the following
 conditions:

- The landlord has knowledge of the bad conditions in your apartment.

- You were current with your rent at the time the landlord received knowledge of the defective conditions in your apartment.

- The defective conditions were not caused by you or anyone in your household or guests.

- You have the ability to put the withheld rent aside and not spend it.

##### Sue your landlord

Massachusetts has very strong laws that require landlords to make
repairs. Sometimes these laws can result in your right to have you rent
abated or reduced -- even if you are behind on your rent. If your
landlord has not been repairing bad conditions, you may be able to sue
your landlord for money

##### Hire a lawyer

In Massachusetts, many of the laws that equire landlords to make repairs also include a part that says the landlord has to pay for your
attorney if you win your lawsuit. This is fall fee shifting. For this reason, you may be able to get a lawyer to represent you without you
having to pay that lawyer. To find a lawyer who specializes in representing tenants, [link to lawyer referral programs].
