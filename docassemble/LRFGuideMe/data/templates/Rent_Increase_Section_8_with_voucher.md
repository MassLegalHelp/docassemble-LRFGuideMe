**Guide Me**: My landlord wants to raise the rent

And

I have a mobile Section 8 or MRVP voucher

If you have a mobile subsidy, the landlord can not raise the rent
without first getting approval from the housing authority that
administers the subsidy.

If your landlord insists you sign something without first getting
approval from the housing authority, contact your worker and ask for
their help.

Never start paying the rent increase -- even if you agree to it -
without getting approval from your worker. Doing so could get both you
and your landlord in trouble with the housing authority.

Even if you agree to the rent increase, your housing authority worker
needs to do the following before a rent increase can go into effect

1.  Your worker will review the fairness of the increase for you.

2.  Your worker will tell you how the rent increase will change what you
    pay for rent.
