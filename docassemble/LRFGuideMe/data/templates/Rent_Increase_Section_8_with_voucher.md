Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

Your landlord wants to raise the rent and you have a mobile Section 8 or MRVP voucher
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a mobile subsidy, your landlord can only raise your rent if
they get approval first. They need approval from the housing authority
that administers the subsidy.

If your landlord insists that you sign something **before** they get
approval from the housing authority, contact your worker and ask for
their help.

Never start paying the rent increase -- even if you agree to it --
before you get approval from your worker.

Paying rent before you get approval could get both you and your landlord
in trouble with the housing authority.

Even if you agree to the rent increase, before a rent increase can
start, your housing authority worker needs to:

1.  Review the increase for you, to make sure it is fair. And

2.  Tell you how the rent increase will change what **you** pay for
    rent.
