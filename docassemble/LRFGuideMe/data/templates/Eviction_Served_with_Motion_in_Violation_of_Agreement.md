Guide Me: Steps to take when... 
================================

You made an agreement with your landlord not to evict you, then they filed a motion that says you \"violated\" your agreement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Show up for the Motion Hearing 

Do not ignore the motion! -- Even if you did not follow the agreement
you need to go to court.

At the hearing, the judge will give you a chance to explain what
happened.

You may be able to get the judge to overlook the violation if:

-   it is a minor violation, or

-   you can show that you can follow the agreement going forward.

Sometimes landlords will agree to re-negotiate the agreement if you have
a reasonable explanation or plan to follow the agreement in future.

#### File a Motion to Amend Agreement 

If you have time, file **your own** Motion to Amend the Agreement.

If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can ask the
landlord to change the agreement.

File a Motion to Amend Agreement to get your landlord back to court so
you can re-negotiate.
