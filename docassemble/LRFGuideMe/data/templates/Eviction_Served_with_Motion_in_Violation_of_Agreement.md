Guide Me: Steps to take when... 
================================

You made an agreement with your landlord not to evict you, then they filed a motion that says you \"violated\" your agreement
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Show up for the Motion Hearing 

Do not ignore the motion! -- Even if you did not follow the agreement
you need to go to court.

At the hearing, the judge will give you a chance to explain what
happened.

You may be able to get the judge to overlook the violation if:

-   it is a minor violation, or

-   you can show that you can follow the agreement going forward.

Sometimes landlords will agree to re-negotiate the agreement if you have
a reasonable explanation or plan to follow the agreement in future.

#### File a Motion to Amend Agreement 

If you have time, file **your own** Motion to Amend the Agreement.

If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can ask the
landlord to to change the agreement.

File a Motion to Amend Agreement to get your landlord back to court so
you can re-negotiate.

#### Until December 31, 2020, you may be eligible to stop an eviction where your landlord is asking for back rent

You might be protected by the federal CDC Moratorium if you

-   cannot pay your full rent because you have lost income or have high
    medical expenses, 

-   are making best efforts to pay the rent including applying for
    financial help, and

-   are likely to become homeless or doubled up if evicted.

[declaration](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/declaration-form.pdf) that you are protected by the federal CDC moratorium on
evictions.
