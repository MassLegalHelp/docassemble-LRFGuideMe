**Here are some steps you can take.**

**Show-Up for the Motion Hearing:**

Don't ignore this motion -- even if you have not complied with the
agreement. At the hearing, the judge will give you a chance to explain
what happened. You may be able to get the judge to agree to overlook the
violation if it is not that "material" or if you can show that you can
continue to comply with the agreement going forward. Sometimes landlords
will agree to re-negotiate the agreement if you have a reasonable
explanation or plan for continuing to comply with the agreement.

**File a Motion To Amend Agreement:**

If there is time, file your own motion to amend the agreement. If you
are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can try to get the
landlord to agree to change the agreement. The way that you can get the
landlord back to court to re-negotiate is to file a Motion to Amend
Agreement.
