#### My landlord wants to evict me 
#### and
#### I made an agreement with my landlord that I have not been able to keep.

Here are some steps you can take.

##### File a Motion To Amend Agreement: 

If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you can try to get the
landlord to agree to change the agreement. The way that you can get the
landlord back to court to re-negotiate is to file a Motion to Amend
Agreement.

##### Talk to Your Landlord:

Some landlords may be willing to renegotiate the terms of your
agreement. If your landlord is willing to do this, you should still file
a Motion to Amend Agreement. At the hearing date, you can have your new
agreement replace the old one. This way, it will be enforced the same
way as the prior agreement.
