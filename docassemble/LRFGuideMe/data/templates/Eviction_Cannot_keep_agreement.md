Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

You cannot keep the agreement you made with your landlord in your eviction case
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### File a Motion to Amend Agreement

If you are having trouble keeping your agreement, you ask the landlord to change the agreement. The way that you can get the landlord back to court to change the agreement is to file a Motion to Amend Agreement. 

If you make an new agreement you can have your new agreement replace the
old one. This way, it will be enforced the same way as the prior
agreement.

####  Talk to Your Landlord

Some landlords may be willing to renegotiate the terms of your
agreement.

If your landlord agrees to change your agreement, you should still file
a Motion to Amend Agreement so that your new agreement can be enforced

####  Until December 31, 2020, you may be eligible to stop an eviction where your landlord is asking for back rent

You might be protected by the federal CDC Moratorium if you

-   cannot pay your full rent because you have lost income or have high
    medical expenses, 

-   are making best efforts to pay the rent including applying for
    financial help, and

-   are likely to become homeless or doubled up if evicted.
