Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

You live in subsidized or public housing, 
------------------------------------------

You think you are paying the wrong rent, and
---------------------------------------------

Your worker or property manager is asking for verifications you cannot get
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Ask for help with getting the verification

If you lost income because you lost your job or some benefits, your
worker should verify this for you.

The worker should ask you to sign a \"release.\" The release is a form
that tells your employer or a government program that you give them
permission to share your information with your worker.

If you lost income because someone moved out, your worker will ask you
for \"verification\" or proof that shows where that person moved.\
If that person is not cooperating with you, write to your worker and
tell them you cannot get proof of the person\'s new address.

Ask the worker about other ways to verify that someone has left.

Your worker **may** accept a signed statement from you that the person
moved out.
