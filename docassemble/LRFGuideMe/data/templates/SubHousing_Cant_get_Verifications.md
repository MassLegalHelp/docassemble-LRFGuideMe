**Ask for Help Getting the Verification:**

If the loss of income is because you lost your job or some benefits,
your worker should be verifying this for you. The worker should have had
you sign a form that allows the worker to get this information directly
from the employer or government program

If the loss of income is because someone moved out, the worker will ask
you for verification of where that person moved to. If that person is
not cooperating with you, tell your worker in writing you can't get it.
Ask the worker about alternative ways to verify that someone has left.
It may be possible to get the worker to accept a signed statement from
you that the person has moved out.
