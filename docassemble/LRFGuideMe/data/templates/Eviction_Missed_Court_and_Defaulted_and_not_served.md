Guide Me: Steps to take when...
===============================

You missed your eviction hearing, you \"defaulted,\" and you have not been served with a notice of a scheduled eviction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not show up for a court hearing, your landlord can \"default\"
you - as long as you are not in active military service. Your landlord
can get a \"judgment for possession,\" an eviction order, if you do not
show up at court for your hearing.

If you owe rent, the order includes \"damages\" in the amount of the
rent the landlord claims you owe.

If you do nothing to remove the default, 11 days from the date of the
default, your landlord can ask the court for an execution. Your landlord
needs an execution to hire a county sheriff or constable to move you out
of your apartment.

#### File a Motion to Remove Default

You can file a Motion to Remove Default Judgment. See [Removing a Default](https://www.masslegallhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf)
in all Housing Superior and District Courts

If the court grants your motion to remove default, the court cancels the default judgment and you go back to where you were in the case, before you missed the hearing.

#### Talk to Your Landlord

Many landlords are still willing to negotiate an agreement with tenants
even after they get a decision from the court.

If your eviction is because you owe rent, some landlords will still
make a payment plan and let you stay - if you can get caught up on your
rent.

Even if your landlord is not interested in letting you stay long-term,
many landlords will agree to give you a reasonable amount of time to
move on your own.

It may cost the landlord more money to hire someone to move you and your
things out of your apartment.

#### Until March 31, 2021, you may be eligible to stop an eviction where your landlord is asking for back rent

You might be protected by the federal CDC Moratorium if you

-   cannot pay your full rent because you have lost income or have high
    medical expenses, 

-   are making best efforts to pay the rent including applying for
    financial help, and

-   are likely to become homeless or doubled up if evicted.

that you are protected by the federal CDC moratorium on evictions.
