#### My landlord wants to evict me 
#### and
#### I missed my court date and I defaulted 
#### and
#### I have not been served with a notice of a scheduled eviction.

*If you do not show up for a court hearing, a landlord has the option of
defaulting you as long as you are not in active military service. This
means the landlord got a judgment for possession (eviction) and, if you
owe rent, damages in the amount of the rent the landlord claims you owe.
If you do nothing to remove the default, eleven days from the date of
the default the landlord can request an execution and after that hire a
county sheriff or constable to evict you.*

Here are some steps you can take.

##### File a Motion to Remove Default: 

You can file a Motion to Remove Default Judgment. Learn more about
filing this motion at
[www.masslegallhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf](http://www.masslegallhelp.org/housing/lt1-booklet-6-removing-default.pdf).

If the court grants your motion to remove default, the judgement that
had been entered gets canceled and you go back to where the case
started.

##### Talk to Your Landlord: 

Many landlords are still willing to negotiate an agreement with you. If
your eviction is because you owe rent, some landlords will still make a
payment plan and let you stay as long as you can get caught up on your
rent. Even if a landlord is not interested in letting you stay long
term, many landlords will agree to give you a reasonable amount of time
to move on your own because the landlord has to pay more money to have
you forcibly evicted.
