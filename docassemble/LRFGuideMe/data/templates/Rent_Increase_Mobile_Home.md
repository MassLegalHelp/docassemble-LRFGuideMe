Guide Me: Steps you can take when...
====================================

Your landlord wants to raise the rent 
--------------------------------------

and you live in a mobile home park
----------------------------------

#### Do you live in town with rent control?

Your mobile home park must ask the town's rent control agency for
permission to raise the rent if you live in one of these towns:

To find out how rent control works, contact your local town or city hall
to get a copy of the rent control regulation.

#### No local rent control

If there is no mobile home rent control where you live, the park owner
can charge any rent they want.\
A park owner may increase your rent, but only if:

1.  All other park tenants get the same rent increase, and

2.  The park owner sends park tenants a rent increase notice that says:

    a.  the tenancy ends in 30 days, and

    b.  tells you the amount of the new rent.

#### Illegal rent increases

The rent increase is illegal if:

-   You live in a town with rent control and your landlord does not obey
    the rent control ordinance.

-   The park owner does not give you correct written notice. Or

-   The rent increase is based on a park rule that is unreasonable or
    unfair.

If you think the rent increase may be illegal, you can call the Attorney
General's Consumer Complaint Division for help:  
(617) 727-8400.
