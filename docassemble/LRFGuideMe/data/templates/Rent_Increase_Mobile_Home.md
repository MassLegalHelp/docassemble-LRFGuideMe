**Guide Me**: My landlord wants to raise the rent

And

I live in a mobile home park

**Do you live in town with rent control?**

If you live in one of these towns, a mobile home park must seeking
permission from the town's rent control agency before it can raise the
rent:

  Belchertown   Bernardston        Boston
  ------------- ------------------ ---------------
  Brookfield    Cheshire           Chicopee
  Dalton        Merrimac           Ludlow
  Middleboro    North Adams        North Reading
  Orange        Palmer             Peabody
  Pittsfield    Raynham            Rockland
  Salisbury     Springfield        Wales
  Warren        West Bridgewater   

To find out how rent control works, you can contact your local town or
city hall to get a copy of the rent control regulation

**No Local Rent Control**

If there is no mobile home rent control where you live, the park owner
can charge any rent they want. A park owner may increase your rent, but
only if:

1.  All other park tenants get the same rent increase, and

2.  The park owner sends park tenants a rent increase notice that says
    that the tenancy ends in 30 days, and what the new rent amount will
    be.

**Illegal Rent Increases**

The rent increase is illegal if:

The landlord violates the rent control ordinance if you live in a town
with rent control.

The park owner does not give you correct written notice.

The rent increase is based on a park rule that is unreasonable or
unfair.

If you suspect that the rent increase is illegal, you can call the
Attorney General's Consumer Complaint Division for help (617) 727-8400.
