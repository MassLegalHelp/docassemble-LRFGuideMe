  start_screen
  #1. Ask the main questions
  main_questions  
  
  #2. Deal with sub questions for each of the 3 main issues
  issue = user_issues
  if issue['subsidized_housing']:    
    #2.1.Deal with sub questions for subsidized housing issues
    subsidized_questions    
    #2.2.Check if "none of the above" is checked
    sub_issue = user_issues_subsidized
    if not sub_issue['verification'] and not sub_issue['lost_income'] and not sub_issue['new_rent']:
      alternate_exit 
  elif issue['eviction']:
    eviction_questions    
  elif issue['rent_increase']:
    rent_increase_questions   
    
  #3. Check if "None of the above" is checked
  elif not issue['bad_conditions'] and not issue['behind_on_rent'] and not issue['complaints']:
