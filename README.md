This project originally was called SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-HousingGuide, owned by Quinten Steenhuis, quinten@lemmalegal.com, designed and written as a student project by Michael Buccino and Melanie Kaufman. 

We inherited the 0.10 version of that project, and on 7/29/2020 moved it to a new location under this new project name, as we continue to adapt it for implementation on the Massachusetts Legal Resource Finder.
